Task description
Benvenuto al Ristorante Il Gambero Rosso. In this CodeReview, you have to create a Delivery page for the best Restaurant in Padova Province, in the North of Italy, using Angular obviously.  

GUI guideline: You are allowed to use CSS and/or bootstrap. 

In order to accomplish this project, you will need to create at least 7 pages/components: NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart) (you are free to create additional components if you have time and inspiration). The NavBar will be always showing no matter what component is triggered, the same for the Footer. Home and About Us should have static content. Menu will hold dynamic content created from objects. On clicking on the Details button it should lead to the details page which will bring specific information from that dish. 

  

Please examine the designs below as a suggestion: 

Home and About Us components will have static content and can have a similar design to the example below. Feel free to provide your content for those pages instead of LoremIpsumDolor üòä : 

 

The Menu component will hold the dynamic content and should present at least 6 dishes with their image, small description and price.  
 

Submission Guidelines: 

Submission guideline note: Standard submission procedure should be used, which includes: Creation of a GitHub project (repository name FE16-CR6-Name), ‚Äúpush‚Äù to the repository and provide the information to CodeFactory through the learning management system (https://lms.codefactory.live/) with the GitHub link for the cloning procedure. 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded: 

(05 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE16-CR6-Name.  

Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Add codefactorygit as a collaborator and assure your repository is set to private. See an example of a GitHub link below: 

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git 

(10 points) The final result of your theme design must be responsive by using css or Bootstrap. 

(15 points) Your project must contain at least 7 components that together will build up your application as follows: NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart) 

(15 points) Use routing to move between the pages without refreshing the browser (SPA). The navbar contains the navigation links that allow you to go through the components and go back to the home page. 

(15 points) Each dish(object) must have at least the following properties: name, image, description, price and availability (Boolean). 

(10 points) If the availability of the dish is true, the buttons ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù must be shown in each dish. If it is false, it shouldn‚Äôt show the buttons for that object, only the dish picture with a message ‚ÄúNot available‚Äù, instead. 

(20 points) Create the functionality that when you click on Order button, the dish will be added to the cart. The user must be able to order as well from the Menu component or from the Details component. The Order component must show the content of the cart. 

(10 points) A details component must be created. It will hold specific information about the dish when clicked on the button Details. The user must be able to order from this component. 
 

Bonus Points: 

(10 points) Display the total of the Bill with a ‚ÄúService‚Äù section that shows 10% of the total amount. 

(10 points) If the Total sum is more than EUR 40, the user gets a 15% discount. The total without discount and the new price with the discount must be neatly shown on the screen.
